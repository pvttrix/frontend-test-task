# Neuffer Frontend Developer Test Task: Shopping Cart Page Implementation

## Description

Implement a responsive shopping cart page based on the provided design mockup. **The mockup serves as a guide for the overall layout, structure, and general appearance; pixel-perfect replication is not required.** However, the final result should visually resemble the mockup reasonably closely.

The task involves fetching initial product data from a public API, displaying cart items with quantity controls, calculating totals, and allowing item removal. You should use **modern Vue.js (e.g., Vue 3 with Composition API preferred)** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, language **TypeScript**. Your implementation choices regarding state management, component structure, and specific reactivity features will be part of the evaluation.

## Objectives (Core Functionality)

1.  **Project Setup:**
    - Set up a modern **Vue.js** project with **TypeScript** (e.g., using **Vite**).
    - Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling.
2.  **Data Fetching:**
    - On component mount, fetch product data from the **FakeStoreAPI**. Use **GET** endpoint from `https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#tag/Products` to get few products.
    - Use this fetched data to populate the initial state of the shopping cart.
3.  **Cart Item Display:**
    - Render the list of cart items based on the fetched data, generally matching the layout shown (image, title, price, quantity, item total). Use relevant fields from the API response.
4.  **Cart Interactivity:**
    - Implement controls to allow users to **adjust the quantity** of each item.
    - Implement functionality to **remove an individual item** from the cart (e.g., via the 'X' button).
    - Implement the **"Clear Cart"** button functionality to remove all items.
    - Implement the **"Add Item"** button functionality to add some product to card using **POST** at `https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#tag/Products`:
      ```javascript
      const product = { title: "New Product", price: 29 }; // this will be in response
      fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(product),
      })
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => console.log(data));
      ```
5.  **Calculations & Summary:**
    - Dynamically calculate and display the overall **Subtotal** for the items in the cart.
    - Display the **Total** in the "Cart Totals" section + **tax 20%**.
    - Include the static "Proceed to Checkout" button (no functionality needed, simple notification is enough).
6.  **Styling & Responsiveness:**
    - Use **Tailwind CSS** utilities to style the component, aiming for a look that follows the structure and general appearance of the provided mockup.
    - Ensure the layout is **responsive** and usable on common screen sizes (mobile, desktop).

## (Optional)

- **Shipping Calculation & State Management:**
  - Implement the "Calculate Shipping" section UI. Shipping Calculation can be mocked (e.g. generate a random cost on button click).
  - Integrate a dedicated state management library like **Pinia** to manage the cart state.
  - Update the "Cart Totals" section to reflect the Subtotal, Shipping cost, and the final Total (Subtotal + Shipping + VAT).
- **Enhanced Validation:** Add more robust input validation (e.g., for direct quantity input if you choose to implement it).
- **Unit/Component Tests:** Write tests for key logic (e.g., calculations, state management actions/getters).

## Additional requirements

- Please make a fork of the repository, create a branch, and commit your change to it.
- Create a pull-request targeting this repository when you are finished.
- Send us a link to the pull-request so that we may review it.
- (Optional but nice) Link to a deployed version (e.g., using Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** Does the application meet the core objectives? Is the cart logic correct?
- **Code Quality & Best Practices:** Is the code clean, readable, maintainable, and follow modern Vue.js and TypeScript standards? (Composition API usage is preferred).
- **Styling & Responsiveness:** Does the UI reasonably match the mockup guide using Tailwind? Is it responsive?
- **State Management:** Is component state managed effectively? If Pinia (or another library) is used for the bonus, is it implemented correctly?
- **Bonus Features:** Assessment of any attempted bonus points.

## Implementation Notes

### What's Done

All core requirements + bonuses are implemented:

- Vue 3 with Composition API & TypeScript
- Pinia for state management
- Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- Full cart functionality (add, remove, update quantities, clear)
- Dynamic calculations (subtotal, tax 20%, shipping, total)
- API integration with FakeStoreAPI
- Form validation with Zod

### Extra Features

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest setup with 31 tests covering store and service logic
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, roles, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Docker**: Full containerization with docker-compose
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit linting/formatting, pre-push tests
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with Tailwind class sorting
